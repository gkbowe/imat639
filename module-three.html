            <h2>Plan Overview</h2>
            <p>Max Q Music current has one retail location with a strong customer base, but virtually no online presence. We believe there is a great opportunity for us to grow and expand if we make a serious effort in expanding our digital  reach.</p>
			  <br>
			<h3>The Opportunity</h3>
			  <p>Retail sales in musical instruments are projected to be over $4 billion for 2019 and expected to grow annually at a rate of over 3.2% <cite><a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/19020000/109/musical-instruments/united-states" target="_blank">(Statista, 2019)</a></cite>. This market is dominated by a few large companies with Guitar Center being the largest. However, the online shopping experiences of these seem to assume shoppers know what they are looking for, making it frustrating and confusing for our core customers. For example, we’re heard from our student and adult beginners that they are intimidated by the shopping experience so much they do not make a purchase. Some have enough told our associated that they almost gave up on learning to play because they purchased an item designed for a skilled musician, not a beginner. </p>
			  <p>We see this as an opportunity to reach this underserved market by providing guided shopping experiences, multimedia content, online tutorials, and product selections geared toward new musicians as well as seasoned professionals.The online store will sell musical instruments, music products, educational materials, sheet music, and other related products as well as provide a way for customers to buy and sell quality used instruments.</p>

				<div class="card-body">
				 <p>Max Q Music’s website will have content designed for several primary customer segments. We believe that these segments are underrepresented within our competitors and therefore present us with a lucrative opportunity.</p>
							  <p>
								Customer segments include: 
								<ul>
								<li>Parents/guardians of school-age children, ages 3-18</li>
								<li>Young adults: 19-25</li>
								<li>Adult learners with enough time for new hobby: 45-65</li>
								<li>Retirees - always wanted to learn, finally have the time (65-85)</li>
								<li>Gift Givers - no knowledge of music but looking for the perfect gift.</li>
								</ul></p>
